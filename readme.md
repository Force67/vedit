# Vedit

## Why?!?
Simple Editor with a simple workflow loop. Set breakpoints like in visual studio. No visual studio bloat. Works great on Linux (in fact i primarily use it there). Loads your makefiles and/or your visual studio projects directly. I mainly made this editor so i can directly modify it on a whim for my personal workflow.

Its fast, cause its written in rust (lol). While iced is not "super" responsive, i try to get the best performance out of it.

It also supports a few extra "me specific" usecases, such as being able to debug windows programs on linux via wine.

Also, im still in the finding phase, so bear with me while i figure out the degree of "ide" that this editor should have.
